Title: Identify, Ping, and Log Internet Provider Connection Data
Note: Currently only unix based systems are supported.
Description: To assist you with troubleshooting internet connection 
    issues and assist in isolating packet loss on your network. It does this by allowing you to 
    retrieve the top trace route destinations your internet provider uses, and recursively 
    ping each server a series of time capturing the results. Each iteration it 
    goes and queries the destinations again, before shuffling the sequence to 
    ensure the analysis is unbiased and consistent across each trace route.
