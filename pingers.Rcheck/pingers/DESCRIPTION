Title: Identify, Ping, and Log ISP Connection Data
Description: The goal of pingers is to assist you with troubleshooting ISP connection 
    issues and assist isolating packet loss. It does this by allowing you to 
    retrieve the top traceroute destinations your ISP uses, and recursively 
    ping each server a seres of time capturing the results. Each iteration it 
    goes and queries the destinations again, before shuffling the sequence to 
    ensure the analysis is unbiased and consistent across each trace route.
